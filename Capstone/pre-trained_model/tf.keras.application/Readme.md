Keras Applications are deep learning models that are made available alongside pre-trained weights. These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning.

Weights are downloaded automatically when instantiating a model. They are stored at ~/.keras/models/.

The following image classification models (with weights trained on ImageNet) are available:
#DenseNet121
#DenseNet169
#DenseNet201
#InceptionResNetV2
#InceptionV3
#MobileNet
#MobileNetV2
#NASNetLarge
#NASNetMobile
#ResNet50
#VGG16
#VGG19
